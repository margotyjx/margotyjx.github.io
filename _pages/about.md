I am a PhD student in the Applied Mathematics, Statistics and Scientific Computation (AMSC) program at The University of Maryland, College Park. I am advised by [Maria Cameron](https://www.math.umd.edu/~mariakc/) and working closely with [Furong Huang](http://furong-huang.com/). My current research is in data-driven methods for understanding rare events in molecular dynamics and trustworthy machine learning. My recent research covers a broad range of topics including optimal control, causality in machine learning and scientific computing.
